# Starknet Interfaces

This repo contains starknet interface standardized by
[SNIPs](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/).

If you are looking for interfaces for popular non-standardized starknet
contracts see
[sn-interfaces-extra](https://github.com/lambda-0x/sn-interfaces-extra).

Currently it contains few interface that are inspiried directly from
[EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) but they will be replaced with equivalent
SNIP versions once they are standarized.

# Contribute

Feel free to open PR for any SNIP proposal that has been standardized.
